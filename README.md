# Team Name: **TheSaints**  

## For Ideathon 4.0

### Idea  
**ShareSphere** is all about bringing people closer and making life a little easier for everyone in the neighborhood. Imagine having a go-to place where you can ask for help or lend a hand with everyday tasks like:  
- 🛒 Picking up groceries when you’re swamped.  
- 📚 Tutoring a student who needs extra support.  
- 🔧 Fixing a leaky faucet or sharing tools.  
- 🐾 Taking care of a pet or running small errands.  

Our platform is designed to feel simple and natural, like talking to a friend. Here’s how it works:  
1. **Easy to Use**: Post what you need or offer help in just a few clicks.  
2. **Local First**: We match you with people nearby, so help is always close.  
3. **Safe Connections**: Chat securely and see ratings to know you’re in good hands.  
4. **Building Trust**: Profiles and reviews make it easy to find reliable helpers or requesters.  

With **ShareSphere**, we’re not just solving problems; we’re building a community where everyone looks out for each other.  
Life’s better when we work together! 🤝

Project Progress:

This project is still in progress, but here’s what’s been done so far:

    User Registration API: A basic user registration system has been set up using Express.js and MongoDB.
        Users can register by providing their name, email, and password.
        Passwords are stored securely (to be further implemented with hashing for security).
    API Endpoints:
        /api/users/register - Allows users to register on the platform.

Technologies Used:

    Node.js: JavaScript runtime for the backend.
    Express.js: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
    MongoDB: NoSQL database to store user data.
    Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling library.
    Express-Validator: Middleware to validate user inputs (email, password).
    JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For user authentication (future implementation).

To Do:

    Implement user authentication with JWT.
    Add the ability to create, update, and delete tasks.
    Implement messaging between users.
    Add reviews and ratings for users.
